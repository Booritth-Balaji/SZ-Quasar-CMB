To Do: 

# To discuss with geet and prof
[ ] Is the error for the angle measurement I'm using okay? (Ang_err)
    check the resolution of the maps, probably 0.5 arcmins
[ ] Ask if the value im using for f_H from the paper is fine
[ ] Check if initial, lower and upper bounds are okay
[ ]

# Regarding MCMC Sampling
[x] The values are coming way to high, need to figure out why is that happening
    and the sampler's acceptance fraction is too low (ideally it should be between 0.2 and 0.5)
[x] Make a Github repo?
[x] Organize all the relevant data files into your folder
[ ] 

[ ] Use the astropy cosmology for convertin angles to distances
